# Network Motif-Based Breast Cancer Subtypes Classification

## Computational Genomics
Author: D.C, Y.L

## Introduction
Breast cancer can be classified into 4 subtypes: Lum A, Lum B, HER2 and Basal. Itâ€™s important to know which kind of subtype of breast cancer a patient has to make the treatment more effective. Prior studies for breast cancer subtyping are usually single-gene based. This project proposes an effective classification method based on motifs information in known breast cancer pathways as well as gene expression microarray data.
